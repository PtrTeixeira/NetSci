Network Science: Dependency Graph Analysis
==========================================

This is the code behind some work in Network Science 
(PHYS 5116 @ Northeasten University) in the analysis 
of dependency graphs for programming language packages, 
in particular taking the Node.JS / NPM ecosystem as a 
model. 

For the sake of expediency, I have checked in an output 
file of the first 1000 nodes (packages) in the graph. 
If you want to re-build the dependency list, or 
build a more complete copy of it, you will likely 
need Python 3.5 or greater. Then you can just do a 
`pip install` and it should work out.

This work depends on, and I am very greatful to, the 
service provided by [npms.io](https://npms.io) in 
indexing Node packages and in making dependencies 
visible.
